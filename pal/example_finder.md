# Example Finder for Azure IoT Physical Abstraction Layer

The Example Finder is a catalog similar to the [Azure IoT Device Catalog](https://catalog.azureiotsuite.com/) which will allow implementors to add their solutions to an example catalog to allow other users to find and re-use the solutions that they've developed for the Azure IoT Physical Abstraction Layer.

In order to add an example to this catalog, the implementor simply to demonstrate that their solution passes the Physical Abstraction Layer's validation test. This can probably be automated.
